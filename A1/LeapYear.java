     * A leap year is defined as:
     *
     * "Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for
     * years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap
     * years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700,
     * 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 are." (United
     * States Naval Observatory)
     *
     * Thus 1996, 2000, and 2004 are leap years, but 1899, 1900, and 1901 are not
     * leap years."
     *
     * @param year The year to test (int greater than 0)
     * @return true if year is a leap year, false otherwise.
